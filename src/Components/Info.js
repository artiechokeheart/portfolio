      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a bubbly and creative individual with a love of problem solving.
        From dungeons and dragons and fiction writing to katas and NYT puzzles,
        I enjoy being able to use my ability to think laterally. My ADHD thrives
        off it and I have never found something that lights up my brain quite
        like solving the problems that coding provides. The satisfaction of
        being able to constantly learn and build something is why I want to be a
        software developer.
